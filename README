Preamble
--------

Bluewatch is a tool to scan for, and keep a log of Bluetooth devices
within range of the host that it is running on. It allows for queries
against its database, and has a facility for executing commands based
on a device becoming visible or moving out of range.

Bluewatch is written in Perl, and has a couple of dependencies - see
the next section for details

Requirements
------------

* Linux

* A supported Bluetooth device (i.e. a USB 'dongle')
  - I have only tested this with a CSR USB dongle, however
    it will work with anything which Net::Bluetooth, and in
	turn Bluez can recognise.

* Perl
  - Net::Bluetooth
    - For scanning for Bluetooth devices
  - Config::XMLPerl
    - For config file support
  - DBI
    - For backend database support

Installation
------------

There are two ways to install Bluewatch:-

1) Automatic

Run ./bluewatch-install and follow the prompts.

2) Manual

Copy:-

* bin/bluewatch to /usr/bin (or similar)
* create /etc/bluewatch/config.xml with similar to the following:-

<?xml version="1.0">
<sql server="localhost" user="bw" pass="4b8ac59c" database="bluewatch" />
<file log="/var/log/bluewatch" run="/var/run/bluewatch" />

* create a MySQL database, with user access as per the config file
* import the schema from sql/bluewatch.sql

Usage
-----

bluewatch -h will give you a list of possible options.

In brief, though:-

  -s				Scan for devices, and update DB
  -l				List present devices
  -la				List all devices
  -q string			Query for a device by MAC or name (case sensitive)
  -x				Wipes the database
  -c device -e cmd  Sets the command executed upon a state change for 'device' to 'cmd'
  -r secs			Repeatedly scan, waiting a minimum of 'secs' seconds between runs
  -b secs			As per -r, but background the process

Warning
-------

It's worth pointing out the possible security implications of the 'state change command'
part of Bluewatch, which will cause a command to be executed with the permissions of
the user that bluewatch is daemonised under. If somebody was to gain access to your
database, that somebody could change the executed command to something destructive.

Consider the implications before enabling this functionality!

Bugs
----

There'll be plenty. Please let me know - my email address is andy.smith@netprojects.org.uk.
